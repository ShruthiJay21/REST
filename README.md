REST API development
A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
How are REST APIs developed?
REST APIs are created with data caching in mind. When a server sends its response to a client, the response should indicate whether the resource provided can be cached, and for how long.
The REST architecture allows API providers to deliver data in multiple formats such as plain text, HTML, XML, YAML, and JSON, which is one of its most loved features.

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and is an architectural style used in modern web development. It defines a set or rules/constraints for a web application to send and receive data. In this article, we will build a REST API in Python using the Flask framework.
